With Streamable, you can!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\ninstall Streamable using npm:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install streamable\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Server-side\r\n\r\nStreamable assumes you're using Express/Connect as your HTTP server, and Socket.io as an async socket connection to the browser.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// setup a basic express 3.x server\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar app     = express();\r\nvar server  = require('http').createServer(app);\r\n\r\n// setup a basic socket.io server\r\nvar io = require('socket.io').listen(server);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce we've setup our server-side dependencies, we need to require streamable. Streamable requires knowledge of our socket.io instance.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamable = require('streamable').streamable(io)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we're all configured, we can start using streamable in our REST API.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/foo', streamable, function(req, res) {\r\n  res.write({foo: 'bar'});\r\n  res.write(\"whatever data I want\");\r\n  res.write(\"multiple\", [\"arguments\", \"work\", \"too\"]);\r\n  res.end();\r\n});\r\n```\r\nServer-side is ready to go.\r\n\r\n### Client-side\r\n\r\nStreamable assumes you have jQuery and Socket.io available to your browser, so make sure they are included in page before streamble's client.js.\r\n\r\nOnce you've included everything you need, add this to your HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  Streamable.get(\"/foo\", {\r\n    onData  : function(d) { console.log('data:' , d); },\r\n    onError : function(e) { console.log('error:', e); },\r\n    onEnd   : function()  { console.log('end'); }\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `onData` call will happen n times--once per write. The `onEnd` call is guaranteed to be called one time after all `onData` and/or `onError` events have fired. If you've passed multiple values to write on the server-side, you can expect them as arguments in the same order of your `onData` event handler.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Derek Perez <derek@derekperez.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
