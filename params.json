With Streamable, you can!\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n[HTTP/1.1 chunked encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding) is a really useful feature of the protocol, however, its really disappointing that we cannot interact with it directly via XHR. Instead, we have to wait for the entire request/response cycle to be complete, before we can start interacting with the data thats coming to us over the wire!\r\n\r\nSince we cannot rely on the HTTP protocol alone, we use a hybrid strategy that negotiates initially over HTTP at first, then coordinates chunked data transmission using asynchronous pipelines. Ideally, this is accomplished using [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), but will feature detect as you would expect, thanks to [socket.io](http://socket.io). So rather than reinventing the HTTP protocol over sockets, we couple the two protocols together into a single API.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\ninstall Streamable using npm:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install streamable\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Server\r\n\r\nStreamable is implemented as an [Express/Connect](http://www.expressjs.com) middleware, so its really simple to use. It assumes you've got both Socket.io and Express modules already included in your app.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// setup an express 3.x server\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar app     = express();\r\nvar server  = require('http').createServer(app);\r\n\r\n// setup a socket.io server and attach it to express\r\nvar io = require('socket.io').listen(server);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've got that setup, its easy to setup Streamable, just pass in your socket.io server instance and the middleware is ready to go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamable = require('streamable').streamable(io);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, we just drop the Streamable middleware into our routes\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/myAPI', streamable, function(req, res){\r\n  res.write('streaming…');\r\n  res.write('streaming…');\r\n  res.end();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe streamable API also allows you to send fatal and non-fatal errors via the `res` object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nres.fatal('this will fire the onError event and close the response stream');\r\nres.error('this will fire the onError event and keep going\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe write API also supports variable arguments, you can expect them as arguments to the `onData` event handler on the client side.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nres.write(\"variable\", [\"args\"], {are: \"supported\"});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n\r\nThe client side requires you to have [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) (for XHR) and the socket.io client-side library. Make sure those are loaded before adding the Streamable client JavaScript module. Once its all loaded up, its really easy to start using.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  Streamable.get(\"/myAPI\", {\r\n    onData  : function()  { console.log('data:' , arguments); },\r\n    onError : function(e) { console.log('error:', e); },\r\n    onEnd   : function()  { console.log('end'); }\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `onData` call will happen n times--once per write. The `onEnd` call is guaranteed to be called one time after all `onData` and/or `onError` events have fired. If you've passed multiple values to write on the server-side, you can expect them as arguments in the same order of your `onData` event handler.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Derek Perez <derek@derekperez.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
