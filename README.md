Have you ever wanted to utilize `Content-Encoding: chunked` in XHR, without waiting for the entire request to complete? With Streamable, you can!

## Overview

[HTTP/1.1 chunked encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding) is a really useful feature of the protocol, however, its really disappointing that we cannot interact with it directly via XHR. Instead, we have to wait for the entire request/response cycle to be complete, before we can start interacting with the data thats coming to us over the wire!

Since we cannot rely on the HTTP protocol alone, we use a hybrid strategy that negotiates initially over HTTP at first, then coordinates chunked data transmission using asynchronous pipelines. Ideally, this is accomplished using [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), but will feature detect as you would expect, thanks to [socket.io](http://socket.io). So rather than reinventing the HTTP protocol over sockets, we couple the two protocols together into a single API.

## Getting Started

install Streamable using npm:

```
npm install streamable
```

## Server

Streamable is implemented as an [Express/Connect](http://www.expressjs.com) middleware, so its really simple to use. It assumes you've got both Socket.io and Express modules already included in your app.

```js
// setup an express 3.x server
var express = require('express');
var app     = express();
var server  = require('http').createServer(app);

// setup a socket.io server and attach it to express
var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
```

Once you've got that setup, its easy to setup Streamable, just pass in your socket.io server instance and the middleware is ready to go.

```js
var streamable = require('streamable').streamable(io);
```

At this point, we just drop the Streamable middleware into our routes

```js
app.get('/myAPI', streamable, function(req, res){
  res.write('streaming…');
  res.write('streaming…');
  res.end();
});
```

The streamable API also allows you to send fatal and non-fatal errors via the `res` object.

```js
res.fatal('this will fire the onError event and close the response stream');
res.error('this will fire the onError event and keep going');
```

the write API also supports variable arguments, you can expect them as arguments to the `onData` event handler on the client side.

```js
res.write("variable", ["args"], {are: "supported"});
```

## Client

The client side requires you to have [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) (for XHR) and the socket.io client-side library. Make sure those are loaded before adding the Streamable client JavaScript module. Once its all loaded up, its really easy to start using.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  Streamable.get("/myAPI", {
    onData  : function()  { console.log('data:' , arguments); },
    onError : function(e) { console.log('error:', e); },
    onEnd   : function()  { console.log('end'); }
  });
</script>
```

the `onData` call will happen n times--once per write. The `onEnd` call is guaranteed to be called one time after all `onData` and/or `onError` events have fired. If you've passed multiple values to write on the server-side, you can expect them as arguments in the same order of your `onData` event handler.
